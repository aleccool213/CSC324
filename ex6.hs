{- Exercise 6, due (Nov 12, 11:50pm)

General exercise instructions:
- Exercises must be done *individually*.
- You may not import any Haskell libraries, unless explicitly told to.
- You may write helper functions freely; in fact, you are encouraged
  to do so to keep your code easy to understand.
- Your grade will be determined by our automated testing.
  You can find some sample tests on the course webpage.
- Submit early and often! MarkUs is rather slow when many people
  submit at once. It is your responsibility to make sure your work is
  submitted on time.
- No late submissions will be accepted!

This exercise is mainly a chance to practice writing code in Haskell,
although we'll take advantage of lazy evaluation to create some nice
infinite data structures. :)

-- DON'T CHANGE IT!
module Ex6 (primes, Tree(Empty, Node), treeHeight) where

-- Question 1
-- Define 'primes', an infinite list of primes (in ascending order).
-- Remember that 1 is not a prime, but 2 is a prime.
-- You may want to use the definition of 'nats' from the lecture


isPrime :: [Integer] -> Integer -> Bool
isPrime (x:xs) n =  x * x > n || rem n x /= 0 && isPrime xs n

primes :: [Integer]
primes = 2 : filter (isPrime primes) [3..]

-- This is a datatype to define a binary tree. It follows the
-- recursive definition of a binary tree, which is:
--   - an empty tree
--   - a node containing a value with a left and right subtree
-- For this exercise, we'll stick with binary trees of integers.
-- In the second constructor, the first 'Tree' represents the left
-- subtree, and the second represents the right subtree.
data Tree = Empty | Node Integer Tree Tree deriving Show

-- An example of a tree.
tree :: Tree
tree = Node 5 (Node 3 Empty
                      (Node 3 Empty Empty))
              (Node 5 (Node 1 Empty Empty)
                      (Node (-10) Empty Empty))


-- Question 2
-- Define 'treeHeight', which takes a tree and returns the height of a tree.
-- Note that the empty tree has a height of 0.
treeHeight :: Tree -> Integer
treeHeight Empty = 0
treeHeight (Node int leftNode rightNode) =
  1 + (max (treeHeight leftNode)  (treeHeight rightNode))
